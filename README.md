## Simple calculator
This is a simple javascript calculator.

The skeleton HTML and CSS uses a table element to create the calculator body.

The calculator logic is handled using vanilla javascript.

The calculator is not responsive. If a mobile device loads it, and it gets turned sideways, the user will be required to scroll.
